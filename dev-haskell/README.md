These packages are largely unmodified from upstream hackage.haskell.org
versions.  They are here instead of portage-stable because they are either
currently not available in Gentoo or the Gentoo versions are outdated.

If current versions of these packages become available in upstream Gentoo, it
should be safe to move them back to portage-stable without worrying about local
modifications.
