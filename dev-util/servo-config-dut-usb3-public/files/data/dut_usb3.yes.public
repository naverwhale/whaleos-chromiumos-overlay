# List of Servo v4 known to support USB3-to-DUT.
#
# Format: One Servo v4 serial number per line.  Blank lines and lines starting
# with # (pound sign) are ignored.
#
# Do NOT list Servos in Google's possession here.  Use the private overlay
# package for that.
#
# When a Servo is listed in multiple dut_usb3.{no,yes} files, the highest file
# in this list wins:
#
#   /etc/servos/dut_usb3.no
#   /etc/servos/dut_usb3.yes
#   /usr/share/servos/dut_usb3.no.*
#   /usr/share/servos/dut_usb3.yes.*
#
# There is generally no need to list any Servo v4 here, since Servod is changing
# to enable USB3 to DUT by default.  See:
# https://issuetracker.google.com/163418494
#
# This file remains available for listing known-good Servos in case the
# known-bad Servo list is discovered to be incomplete, requiring flipping back
# to USB2 by default.
