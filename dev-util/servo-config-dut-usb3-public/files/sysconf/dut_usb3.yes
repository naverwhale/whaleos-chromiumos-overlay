# List of Servo v4 known to support USB3-to-DUT.
#
# Format: One Servo v4 serial number per line.  Blank lines and lines starting
# with # (pound sign) are ignored.
#
# When a Servo is listed in multiple dut_usb3.{no,yes} files, the highest file
# in this list wins:
#
#   /etc/servos/dut_usb3.no
#   /etc/servos/dut_usb3.yes
#   /usr/share/servos/dut_usb3.no.*
#   /usr/share/servos/dut_usb3.yes.*
#
# This /etc file is for making local changes in your CrOS SDK chroot to
# override the /usr/share files.  In CrOS source control all Servo listings
# belong in the /usr/share files, and this file should remain empty.
