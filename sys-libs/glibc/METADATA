    # CVE-2023-25139 was introduced in glibc 2.36 so 2.35 is not affected.

    # CVE-2023-4813 does not exist in glibc >2.35, and is only exploitable if
    # `/etc/nsswitch.conf` sets `SUCCESS=continue` or `SUCCESS=merge`. ChromeOS
    # sets neither of these in `chromeos-base/nsswitch`.

    # CVE-2023-5156 is a glibc 2.35 vulnerability: the fix for CVE-2023-4813
    # introduced the potential for memory leaks. Since we didn't pick a fix for
    # CVE-2023-4813, this can be safely ignored.

    # CVE-2023-4527 only applies if `no-aaaa` is in `/etc/resolv.conf`, and
    # ChromeOS never uses that configuration.
    # TODO(b/301540942): remove this once glibc is upgraded to 2.37 & a backport
    # is landed.
