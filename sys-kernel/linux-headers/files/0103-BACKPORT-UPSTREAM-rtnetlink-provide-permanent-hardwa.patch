Subject: [PATCH] BACKPORT: UPSTREAM: rtnetlink: provide permanent hardware
 address in RTM_NEWLINK

Permanent hardware address of a network device was traditionally provided
via ethtool ioctl interface but as Jiri Pirko pointed out in a review of
ethtool netlink interface, rtnetlink is much more suitable for it so let's
add it to the RTM_NEWLINK message.

Add IFLA_PERM_ADDRESS attribute to RTM_NEWLINK messages unless the
permanent address is all zeros (i.e. device driver did not fill it). As
permanent address is not modifiable, reject userspace requests containing
IFLA_PERM_ADDRESS attribute.

Note: we already provide permanent hardware address for bond slaves;
unfortunately we cannot drop that attribute for backward compatibility
reasons.

v5 -> v6: only add the attribute if permanent address is not zero

(cherry picked from commit f74877a5457d34d604dba6dbbb13c4c05bac8b93

Conflicts:
   include/uapi/linux/if_link.h
   net/core/rtnetlink.c

Conflict resolution:
  - +10 in the enum value accounts for the following values that are
    dropped from the upstream
        IFLA_NEW_NETNSID,
        IFLA_IF_NETNSID,
        IFLA_TARGET_NETNSID = IFLA_IF_NETNSID, /* new alias */
        IFLA_CARRIER_UP_COUNT,
        IFLA_CARRIER_DOWN_COUNT,
        IFLA_NEW_IFINDEX,
        IFLA_MIN_MTU,
        IFLA_MAX_MTU,
        IFLA_PROP_LIST,
        IFLA_ALT_IFNAME, /* Alternative ifname */
  - moved filling of the IFLA_PERM_ADDRESS after IFLA_ADDRESS since in
    the cherry-pick it ended up in the middle of the af_ops loop at the
    end
  - adapted the message size calculation for missing attributes
