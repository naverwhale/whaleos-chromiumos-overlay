# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# This is unloved by mesa, and should never be pulled into the targets.
# It is actually for clang and ASAN that we want to have edge versions.
# This should be kept in sync with package.keywords.

# These are packages listed in package.provided. These are generally supposed
# to be BDEPENDs, but the packages that haven't updated to EAPI7 have them
# listed as DEPEND. We list the packages here in addition to the
# package.provided because package.provided only matches using the full version
# number vs package.mask which doesn't need a version number. By listing the
# package here, we can cause analysis failures if a package is upreved and
# the package.provided wasn't updated.
