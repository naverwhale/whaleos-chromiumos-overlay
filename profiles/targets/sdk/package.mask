# virtual/tmpfiles and virtual/udev each try and use systemd-utils since it's
# the first one listed, but we really want to use sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles,
# and sys-fs/udev for the SDK.
#
# sys-apps/systemd-utils[udev] doesn't work because we don't have all the user
# and group accounts that the package requires.
#
# sys-apps/systemd-utils[tmpfiles] should in theory work fine, but we are
# currently using sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles.
sys-apps/systemd-utils

# We really don't want to use sys-apps/shadow in the SDK. See also its
# package.provided entry.
