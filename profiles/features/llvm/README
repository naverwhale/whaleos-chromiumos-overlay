This directory centralizes the changes needed to build packages with Clang/LLVM.

To build packages with Clang/LLVM for a board, create a profile in the overlays
and point its parent to the appropriate architecture here. For example, to add
an llvm profile for daisy:

  $ mkdir overlays/overlay-daisy/profiles/llvm
  $ printf "../base\nchromiumos:features/llvm/arm" > \
    overlays/overlay-daisy/profiles/llvm/parent

A private profile may be needed as well.

  $ mkdir private-overlays/overlay-daisy-private/profiles/llvm
  $ printf "../base\ndaisy:llvm" > \
    private-overlays/overlay-daisy-private/profiles/llvm/parent
