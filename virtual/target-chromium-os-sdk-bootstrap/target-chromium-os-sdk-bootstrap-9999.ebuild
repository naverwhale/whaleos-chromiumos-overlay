DESCRIPTION="List of packages needed to generate a Stage 2 and Stage 3 SDK
tarball. This set of packages should be as small as possible. All the packages
listed here will be implicit dependencies to ALL packages built by bazel. This
means that if any of these dependencies change, all packages will be rebuilt.
If a package needs a host tool that is not listed here it should be listed in
the package's BDEPEND. The USE flags for these packages should also be adjusted
to limit the number of runtime dependencies that are pulled in."
