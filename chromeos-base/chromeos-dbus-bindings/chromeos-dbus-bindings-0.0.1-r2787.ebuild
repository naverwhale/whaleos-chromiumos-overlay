# Note: mainly for the packages using this tool.
# in order to rebuild the packages using this tool on updating this package,
# they should have
#
#   DEPEND="chromeos-base/chromeos-dbus-bindings:="
#
# in addition to
#
#   BDEPEND="chromeos-base/chromeos-dbus-bindings"
#
# Background: there are two reasons that just having BDEPEND does not work.
# Due to b/187792813, currently BDEPEND dependencies are ignored on building
# sysroot.
# Also, even if it is not ignored, in the current portage build system,
# BDEPEND does not support SLOT nor SUBSLOT.
# Thus, to workaround them, we're using SUBSLOT of DEPEND. To make it work,
# this package leaves SLOT to cros-workon's default "0/${PVR}", and packages
# using this tool need to have DEPEND dependency.
